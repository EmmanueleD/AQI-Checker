## Description


This application is the final project for the Javascript advanced course by [Start2impact](www.start2impact.it) 

The goal of this project is to display the AQI (Air quality index) from around the world.

This project uses data from the [World Air Quality Index project](https://aqicn.org/contact/#/w/es), and uses [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) to build the map


## Preview and usage

As the app loads it will show you the nearest station to your position.

Then you can search for places (cities, nations, etc.) in the search bar.

In case that there isn't an available station in the location you searched, the app will set the view of the map at your location so you can check available stations near you
